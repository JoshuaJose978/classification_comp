A comparison of 7 classificatin methods on the Palmer Penguins data

Used a Machine Learning Pipeline, where the data goes through a standard scaler first and after that goes through each classifier. The model is compared using accuracy as the comparison measure and I've also plotted the confusion matrix for all of the classifiers.
